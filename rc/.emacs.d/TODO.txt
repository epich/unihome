Issues:
   : Backspace to tab stop backward-delete-whitespace-to-tab-stop
      : Doesn't correctly handle backspace when there's a selection.
         : Snag with solution:
            : Go into insert mode
            : Shift select text
            : C-h k verifies backspace calls backward-delete-char-untabify
            : Works:
               : Hit Backspace key when .emacs bound it to backward-delete-char-untabify
            : Does not work:
               : M-x backward-delete-char-untabify
            : Does not work:
               : Hit backspace key when .emacs bound it to backspace-whitespace-to-tab-stop
   : If I C-c or backspace to beginning of evil-search prompt, I have to wait in order to enter more input.  How to fix?
   : Editing Lisp
      : Have editing functions operate on an sexp when point is within it.
         : eg "sek" inside an sexp would remove the parens which immediately surround point
      : Command to delete all of sexp except what's marked.
      : Syntax highlighting:
         : Pairs of parens in different colors, bottom up from point
            : See code samples at: http://community.schemewiki.org/?scheme-faq-language
            : Perhaps extending paren (which provides show-paren-mode) is doable.  paren.el looks fairly simple.
               : Uses overlays
            : Rainbow Delimiters is related, but colors from top down.
               : Uses font lock
                  : Presumably because it highlights parens throughout the buffer
                  : Perhaps also because coloring doesn't change when point moves
      : Review lisp.el for useful functions.

         : Compare with Edebug bindings

            : Make like Edebug
            : Define Key Translation from "sg<key>" to "C-x C-a C-<key>"
               : Does the hyperify example in the Elisp manual's documentation of key-translation-map help?
               : Bind a function to "sg", read-event, use event-modifiers function to check if control is applied, ...
         : Bind SPC to step when debugger is active.
      : Create function that generates all of the key-translation-map additions for C- keys.
   : Key bindings in minibuffer:

      : Is there a way to disable electric-pair-mode in the minibuffer?
   : How to automatically wrap text and code at 80 columns?
      : Auto fill mode?
   : When up arrowing through search history, Vim goes to end of line, Evil beginning.
      : This is consistent with Emacs minibuffer in general.  Investigate

   : C-c bug:
      : Occasionally I get to a state which looks like insert, but has a C-c mapping for keyboard-quit.
   : How to mark search terms with different colors?
      : Submit RFE to Evil for a function analogous to highlight-regexp and highlight-phrase .
      : Need Evil analog to highlight-regexp and highlight-phrase
      : Look more at evil-ex-make-hl
      : Need a way to clear them.  evil-ex-delete-hl perhaps.
   : Learn Edebug
      : Make it so as space uses the debugger's keybinding instead of Evil, in normal/motion state.  See solution above under "Keymapping".
   : Look into using undo-tree extension.
      : If it doesn't work out, consider mapping U to undo-only .
   : Learn about Dired
      : Is there a notion of finding a set of files based on a criteria (search term, use of symbol), then iteratively visiting just those?
      : Dired doesn't update when a directory is created separately.  Including when Auto Revert is enabled.
   : CEDET
      : Display in minibuffer undermines promptings and my ability to read them.

      : Hack to use CEDET in Emacs
   : Multi window navigation
      : Set up so as motion commands will go to all windows.
         : Make toggle for on and off.
   : Ediff
      : Deficiencies
         : When navigating in non changed regions, other window should navigate automatically in sync.
            : There is v, V, <, > commands, but why shouldn't it integrate with all existing motions?
               : v and V don't even resync the windows if they get out of sync.
         : Highlighting is overkill, hides font locking etc.
            : Can we use indicators in the margin?
               : How to indicate the intra line diffs this way?
                  : Perhaps with underline or bold face?
         : Should open vertically by default.
            : Set custom value, but doesn't work.
               : '(ediff-merge-split-window-function (quote split-window-vertically))
               : Seems ediff-merge-split-window-function is neither a variable nor function.
         : ediff-patch-file alters the file and saves.  What if I just want to preview the patch?
            : Ediff manual suggests ediff-patch-file is the only way.
            : ediff-patch-buffer doesn't work for multi file diffs.
         : Is there a way to forego having another window at all, and I can simply bind useful Ediff commands myself.

   : Double click select:
      : Need to be able to double click a file path and have it select all of it.

   : Tabs
      : Is there a way to dynamically determine tab stops based on analyzing how indentation is used in file?
         : Some extensions:

            : guess-style.el
            : cc-guess.el
               : Documented as being a part of CC Mode and a part of GNU Emacs.
               : Had to download newer version to get style guessing feature.
               : Seems to work (M-x c-guess), but tab stops aren't updated.
               : Investigate per-buffer initialization which executes c-guess then sets the tab stops based on the c-guess.
                  : Invoking c-guess guess and installs the style.
                  : c-basic-offset is updated, likely to use this to set tab stops.
                  : Need to time initialization of many files
                     : If necessary, reduce default size of region to search for guessing style.
                  : Doesn't work: calling c-guess from the c-mode-common-hook
                  : Does work: M-x c-guess
                  : c-guess does a lot of other things I think, which makes it run long.

Evil bugs (submitted):
   : Updating of highlighted search
      : I find the highlights for my searches with evil-search don't update as I'd expect.  Examples:
         1: Search on a term that appears throughout file.  Hold {{{j}}}.  Search terms will scroll in and out of view without becoming highlighted.
         2: Search for foo: {{{/foo}}}.  Put point over "f", {{{x}}} to delete it.  oo remains highlighted.  Moving around with {{{j}}}, {{{k}}} doesn't update the highlighting.
         3: Similarly, inserting text before "foo" creates incorrect highlighting.  {{{i}}}, type "baz", now "bazfoo" is highlighted.
         4: In Vim, if I search and replace (with {{{:1,$s/old/new/g}}}), then undo, the "old" string is highlighted.  Evil doesn't do that.  In Vim I liked this for verifying complex search and replace operations.
         5: Similarly, in Vim, a search and replace would use the new search term for further {{{n}}}, {{{N}}}.  So {{{:1,$s/old/new/g}}}, then {{{n}}} would go to instances of "old".
