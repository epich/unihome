      : Can't do: v /search-term
         : Text doesn't highlight to search term

         : As evidence by undoing in region with undo-tree
         : Does work when doing 0v-
      : After a while, search and replace becomes buggy.  These have possibly the same root cause:
         : Highlight region, search and replace, entire file is changed!

               : Uses font lock

Evil bugs (submitted):
   : Updating of highlighted search
      : I find the highlights for my searches with evil-search don't update as I'd expect.  Examples:
         1: Search on a term that appears throughout file.  Hold {{{j}}}.  Search terms will scroll in and out of view without becoming highlighted.
         2: Search for foo: {{{/foo}}}.  Put point over "f", {{{x}}} to delete it.  oo remains highlighted.  Moving around with {{{j}}}, {{{k}}} doesn't update the highlighting.
         3: Similarly, inserting text before "foo" creates incorrect highlighting.  {{{i}}}, type "baz", now "bazfoo" is highlighted.
         4: In Vim, if I search and replace (with {{{:1,$s/old/new/g}}}), then undo, the "old" string is highlighted.  Evil doesn't do that.  In Vim I liked this for verifying complex search and replace operations.
         5: Similarly, in Vim, a search and replace would use the new search term for further {{{n}}}, {{{N}}}.  So {{{:1,$s/old/new/g}}}, then {{{n}}} would go to instances of "old".
      : Bug submitted to Evil project.
         : Issue 1 was solved with a defcustom.
   : In Evil motion state, can't mouse click buttons.  RET works however.
   : Selecting only part of line and doing s/  */\n/g replaces whole line, including outside of selection.
      : Vim behaves similarly.
