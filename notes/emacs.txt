Issues low priority:
   : Figure out how to edit elisp code efficiently.
      : Paredit
         : Set up enabling
         : Set up key bindings
      : Ideas:
         : select text, enclose in parens,
            : ... move point to beginning
            : ... move point to end
         : select text, remove enclosing parens.
         : highlight matching parens in different colors, but only those that enclose point.
   : Have the p command also do a ==
      : If not too hard, make this conditional on the line pasting to is whitespace only.
      : File bug about pasting with 'p' on lines with no chars.  A space char is effectively created.
         : If fixed, undo p and P swapping in evil-normal-state-map .
   : Figure out how to byte compile .el files and add it to buildEmacsD.py for yasnippet and ajc.
   : Repeat . command bugs:
      : Doesn't work when switching buffers.  Sometimes does.
      : Applies the wrong command under some circumstances I don't quite know.
         : Insert debug statements to find out.
      : Pasting text into Emacs isn't recorded to repeat ring.
   : Java development
      : Java Auto Complete
         : Popup causes several seconds of delay.  What's the cause?
            : Try advice in dev's email, generate own smaller set of Java tags.
         : Why is there no popup for ajc-import-class-under-point?
             : auto-complete places text under point.  See mailing list.
   : File reloading:
      : Figure out how to make reloading a file from disk less annoying.
         : It would be good to have similar abstraction as Vim:
            : When leaving file that is unsaved, prompt the user.  Allow for an override.
            : When visiting a file, reload it from disk.
      : A solution to this should also solve Clearcase checkout annoyances.  clearcase.el slows down init.
      : auto-revert
         : Doesn't revert file permissions, even though revert-buffer does.
            : Submitted bug report to GNU, ID 11549, merged with ID 11412.
         : Has high latency
            : Might be configurable
         : Flash screen when auto revert occurs.
      : revert-buffer invocation
         : Perhaps when start viewing buffer
            : Investigate using window-scroll-functions for this.
               : See http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Window-Hooks.html
               : Tried copying Evil's example for using window-scroll-functions, but can't get my-window-scroll invoked.
         : Consider whether I'm ok with losing undo history.  Maybe make it conditional for the need to revert.
   : Explore dired
   : Smart editing:
      : Need to specify how many tabs to continue code lines with.
         : Done for Python (as much as can be)
         : Do for C like languages
         : Do for XML
   : Searching issues:
      Highlight updating:
         :
            /\${
            deleted {
            $ still highlighted
         :
            /string1
            n
            i
            string2
            string2 is highlighted
         : Undoing.  I'm accustomed to doing using undo to review complex search and replace.  Evil doesn't highlight what was replaced after the undo.
         : Scrolling with the mouse wheel whilst inputting a search and replace.  Evil shows prior search term instead of what's being searched and replaced.
         : Pasting text which contains the search term.
         : Scrolling very fast (see highlight updating in ; and ; key bindings)
      : When up arrowing through search history, Vim goes to end of line, Evil beginning.
   : Double click select:
      : Need to be able to double click a file path and have it select all of it.
      : Double clicking a / char selects up to the . (exclusive).
      : See: http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-gnu-emacs/2008-12/msg00015.html
   : Syntax highlighting:
      : Not keen on (in Python) strings and comments getting a similar color.
   : Look into using undo-tree extension.
   : Cursor position is difficult to discern over highlighted areas.
   : Make Emacs state visually obvious.  Ideas:
      : Have Emacs state be black fg on white bg
      : Have the status line be a different color based on evil state.
         (set-face-background 'modeline "Blue")
         Use hooks
      : Could also set color of cursor instead:
         See http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.vim-emulation/1170
   : How to mark search terms with different colors?
      : Submit RFE to Evil for a function analogous to highlight-regexp and highlight-phrase .
      : Need Evil analog to highlight-regexp and highlight-phrase
      : Look more at evil-ex-make-hl
      : Need a way to clear them.  evil-ex-delete-hl perhaps.
   : Screen flashing:
      : When finished with a cycle of search in a file
   : Get % to match <> such as in C++ or Java.
   : Set title to include host and directory (after file's basename)
   : buffer-menu
      : Split to the right.
      : Display full file basename or at least widen column width.
      : Set the GTK frame title to any of the filenames, be it last visited, top of list, currently selected, whatever.
   : Navigating source code:
      : See a called function impl.
      : See who calls the currently viewed function.
      : Read the "Tags Table" section of the GNU Emacs manual.
   : How to toggle display of line wrapping?
   : Visual mode
      : Bug:
         : Select text with v
         : Select different text with mouse
         : Both are highlighted, but y will only yank the second.
         : Report submitted to project.
      : Bug:
         : Select with mouse, char under point is not highlighted, but it is with v selection.
         : Report submitted to project.
   : Annoying prompts:
      : When exiting with unsaved changes.
   : Optimize Emacs startup
      : When loading several .java files, observed it can half a second for each Java file.

   : Debugging through logs
      : Add log key bindings for:
         : C and C++
         : Python
         : Shell (echo)
      : Is ll-debug.el useful (doesn't look like it)?
   : Tabs
      : Is there a way to dynamically determine tab stops based on analyzing how indentation is used in file?
         : Some extensions:
            : guess-offset.el
            : guess-style.el
            : cc-guess.el
               : Documented as being a part of CC Mode and a part of GNU Emacs.
               : Had to download newer version to get style guessing feature.
               : Seems to work (M-x c-guess), but tab stops aren't updated.
               : Investigate per-buffer initialization which executes c-guess then sets the tab stops based on the c-guess.
                  : Invoking c-guess guess and installs the style.
                  : c-basic-offset is updated, likely to use this to set tab stops.
                  : Need to time initialization of many files
                     : If necessary, reduce default size of region to search for guessing style.
                  : Doesn't work: calling c-guess from the c-mode-common-hook
                  : Does work: M-x c-guess
   : Figure out what the debris files Emacs leaves behind are about, and whether to change settings to not create them.
      : Determined what they are.
      : Decide if I want to place them under a dir in my home.
   : Opening through symlinks in an hg repo is slow by a factor of about 5.
   : Logging
      : Is there a way to get the current function's name, in order to put in log-msg prefix.
      : Is there a way to modify the message function (with defadvice or otherwise) to prepend timestamp?
   : C-c issues:
      : Need to handle escaping out of other unofficial Evil states, such as =
