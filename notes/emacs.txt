Things to mention about evil:
   : If someone does (lazy-highlight-cleanup nil) in their .emacs to make lazy highlighting persist, it is not honored because of a call to (lazy-highlight-cleanup t).  This is no difference to me since I ended up using the evil-search evil-search-module
   : Some of the customizations don't work when work when before, some after the evil init lines:
      (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/evil")
      (require 'evil)
      (evil-mode 1)
   Doesn't work if after evil init:
      '(evil-overriding-maps nil)
   Doesn't work if before evil init:
      '(evil-search-module (quote evil-search))
   If there's a best practice for avoiding this gotcha, we should add it to the Wiki.  eg is there a call we can make to reinitialize evil?

Writeup
---
Another consideration is whether Evil can generalize regexes as Vim understands them in such a way that they can be used with other Emacs functions.  For example, I found highlight-regexp/highlight-phrase useful enough to keymap:
   (define-key evil-motion-state-map "sh" 'highlight-phrase)

If I could somehow use a regex as discussed here (\t \n \r chars, disabled case-replace) with these or similar highlight functions, that would be very useful.
