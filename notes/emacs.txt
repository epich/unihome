      : Ask on Emacs mailing list about this topic.
         : Is there reason to have a defcustom for those that wish the alternate abstraction?

   : Keyboard macros
      : Weird bug:
         : In scratch buffer, in one insertion, create, left justified:
            a
            b
            c

            b
            c
         : Use the Emacs style kbdmacro to consolidate into three lines of "a b c".
         : Hit 'u' for undo.
         : Entire contents of scratch disappear, including the top default comments.
      : Does Evil's keyboard macro ('q') integrate better with the undo system?
      : Eliminate [ and ] as Evil prefix keys.  I wish to bind them to C-x ( and C-x )
   : Updating of highlighted search
      : I find the highlights for my searches with evil-search don't update as I'd expect.  Examples:
         1: Search on a term that appears throughout file.  Hold {{{j}}}.  Search terms will scroll in and out of view without becoming highlighted.
         2: Search for foo: {{{/foo}}}.  Put point over "f", {{{x}}} to delete it.  oo remains highlighted.  Moving around with {{{j}}}, {{{k}}} doesn't update the highlighting.
         3: Similarly, inserting text before "foo" creates incorrect highlighting.  {{{i}}}, type "baz", now "bazfoo" is highlighted.
         4: In Vim, if I search and replace (with {{{:1,$s/old/new/g}}}), then undo, the "old" string is highlighted.  Evil doesn't do that.  In Vim I liked this for verifying complex search and replace operations.
         5: Similarly, in Vim, a search and replace would use the new search term for further {{{n}}}, {{{N}}}.  So {{{:1,$s/old/new/g}}}, then {{{n}}} would go to instances of "old".
      : Bug submitted to Evil project.
         : Issue 1 is resolved by changing evil-ex-hl-idle-update function's call to run-at-time, using 0.01 instead of 0.1.

         : Give Edebug keymap priority for SPC over Evil.
      : Create function that generates all of the key-translation-map additions for C- keys.
      : The key translation approach can make some key sequences inaccessible if defined in other keymaps.
         : Is there a way to use read-event function, which is known to not reference key-translation-map?
         : Is there an ideal way to circumvent the key-translation-map?
         : Control whether additions to key-translation-map are active.
            : Are there supported ways in Emacs?
            : Use the Evil state hooks.
               : Problematic -- switching between buffers in different states doesn't run the hooks.
         : Have key-translation-map map to function which:
            : Returns translation if in normal, motion, visual states
            : Else returns the same key.
               : How does the bound function determine the original key?

   : File reloading:
      : Figure out how to make reloading a file from disk less annoying.
         : It would be good to have similar abstraction as Vim:
            : When leaving file that is unsaved, prompt the user.  Allow for an override.
            : When visiting a file, reload it from disk.
      : A solution to this should also solve Clearcase checkout annoyances.  clearcase.el slows down init.

                  : auto-revert-handler is in autorevert.el

      : Write a section in the EmacsWiki for managing keymappings with Evil
         : Prereqs:
            : Write code to copy from evil-emacs-state-modes to evil-motion-state-maps
            : Write Evil state hooks to set and unset key translation mappings
            : Does the \ command run the Evil state hooks?
               : Looks like the answer is yes in code
               : Verify through manual testing
            : Try it all out to be sure
         : Outline:
            : Basics:
               : Setting
               : Unsetting
               : Conflicts between motion and normal
               : Unset a key before making it a prefix key
            : Key Translation approach
               : Set and unset in Evil state hooks
               : Conflicts with key bindings of other modes
            : Buffers with no raw text editing
            : Motion vs normal states
            : Moving evil-emacs-state-modes to evil-motion-state-modes
            : Setting evil-overriding-maps and evil-intercept-maps to nil
            : Moving key bindings from motion to normal state keymaps
            : Operator pending state

         : Draft:
            Managing key bindings with Evil
               If you want to use the full power of Emacs in Vim-like ways (ie using short key sequences near home row instead of Control-Shift-Nonsense), this section provides some guidance.  This guide assumes you've read the Evil manual section "Modes and states".
               Basic key bindings

Notes:
   : Setup on RHEL5
       wget http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/emacs/emacs-23.4.tar.gz
       ./configure --prefix=/nas/home/boreilly/sw/emacs-install --with-gif=no
   : Editting macros
      C-x( 	start-kbd-macro 	Starts recording keystrokes
      C-x) 	end-kbd-macro	Stop recording keystrokes
      C-xe 	call-last-kbd-macro 	
      C-g 	keyboard-quit 	quit defining
      C-uC-x( 		Executes current macro and opens it for appending new commands
              name-last-kbd-macro 	Gives the macro a name
              insert-kbd-macro	inserts the textual definition at the current point
      usually done into the .emacs file
              set-local-key key macroname 	binds the key name to the macro for this session
      C-uC-xq		Insert a pause into a macro definition
      ESC C-c 	Continue in the macro after a pause
   : C-z cycles between <N> and <E> evil states.
   : Buffer menu notes:
      : To see it:
         : C-x C-b 
         : buffer-menu
      : 1 selects one file in one window.
      : bs-show is a more barebones menu function.
   : Windows notes:
      : Gets rid of all other windows: C-x 1
      : Change to other window: C-x o
      : Split the same window side by side: C-x 3
   : Keymap notes:
      : An entry in a keymap can redirect to the key in a specified alternate keymap.
      : To determine the code for a key (C-c for example):
         (progn ?\C-c)
   : Ediff notes:
      : Multi-file patches:
         : Requires context or unified diffs (-c or -u).
            : Use diff -u
         : Doesn't appear to work on directory structures
            : Workaround: Copy files to a directory to structure is flat
         : Steps:
            : Open emacs on the diff file
            : M-x ediff-patch-file
            : Follow prompts
   : Use M-; on a selection to comment it out.
   : (define-key evil-normal-state-map "o" 'next-buffer)
   : (define-key evil-normal-state-map "O" 'previous-buffer)
