Notes:
   : C-z cycles between <N> and <E> evil states.
   : Buffer menu notes:
      : To see it:
         : C-x C-b 
         : buffer-menu
      : 1 selects one file in one window.
      : bs-show is a more barebones menu function.
   : Windows notes:
      : Gets rid of all other windows: C-x 1
      : Change to other window: C-x o
   : (define-key evil-normal-state-map "o" 'next-buffer)

Issues:
   : File reloading:
      : Figure out how to make reloading a file from disk less annoying.
         : It would be good to have similar abstraction as Vim:
            : When leaving file that is unsaved, prompt the user.  Allow for an override.
            : When visiting a file, reload it from disk.
         : Auto saving and reverting
            : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1655695/i-dont-need-saving-how-to-keep-emacs-buffers-in-sync-with-files
         : Would be nice if buffer menu displayed the files that would change if reverted, so I could manually handle it.
      : *Messages* has line: test.py has auto save data; consider M-x recover-this-file
         : Possible source of startup starting to take a longer time.
      : A solution to this should also solve Clearcase checkout annoyances.
   : Python indenting:
      : Evil visual mode indenting doesn't work right.
   : Overwriting of evil-repeat-ring
      : When backing out of some operations before making an insertion change, Evil overwrites the evil-repeat-ring, while Vim doesn't.
         : Shift-.
         : r
   : Searching issues:
      Highlight updating:

            $ still highlighted

   : Debugger mode overrules the o keymapping
   :::
   : Double click select:
      : Need to be able to double click a file path and have it select all of it.
      : Double clicking a / char selects up to the . (exclusive).
      : See: http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-gnu-emacs/2008-12/msg00015.html
   : Pasting
      : Ctrl-Shift-v doesn't paste.
      : Ctrl-y does, but if Evil mappings are removed.
   : Smart editting:
      : Need to specify how many tabs to continue code lines with.
      : Need to have backspace delete whitespace to tab stops.
   : Syntax highlighting:
      : Not keen on (in Python) strings and comments getting a similar color.
   : Look into using undo-tree extension.
   : Cursor position is difficult to discern over highlighted areas.
   : Make Emacs state visually obvious.  Ideas:
      : Have Emacs state be black fg on white bg
      : Have the status line be a different color based on evil state.
         (set-face-background 'modeline "Blue")
         Use hooks
      : Could also set color of cursor instead:
         See http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.vim-emulation/1170
   : How to mark search terms with different colors?
   : Screen flashing:
      : When finished with a cycle of buffers
      : When finished with a cycle of search in a file
   : Get % to match <> such as in C++ or Java.
   : buffer-menu
      : Split to the right.
      : Display full file basename or at least widen column width.
      : Set the GTK frame title to any of the filenames, be it last visited, top of list, currently selected, whatever.
   : Navigating source code:
      : See a called function impl.
      : See who calls the currently viewed function.
      : Read the "Tags Table" section of the GNU Emacs manual.
   : Why did C-h f apropos evil.*key fail to find evil-define-key?  It found it as non regex.
   : How to toggle display of line wrapping?
   : Visual mode
      : Bug:
         : Select text with v
         : Select different text with mouse
         : Both are highlighted, but y will only yank the second.
   : Annoying prompts:
      : When exiting with unsaved changes.
      : When opening file greater than 14MB.
   : Optimize Emacs startup
      : When loading several .java files, observed it can half a second for each Java file.
      : Try advice at: http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/OptimizingEmacsStartup
   : Debugging through logs
      : Add log key bindings for:
         : C and C++
         : Python
         : Shell (echo)
      : ll-debug.el useful (doesn't look like it)?
   : Tabs
      : Is there a way to dynamically determine tab stops based on analyzing how indentation is used in file?
         : Some extensions:
            : guess-offset.el
            : guess-style.el
            : cc-guess.el
               : Documented as being a part of CC Mode and a part of GNU Emacs.
               : Had to download newer version to get style guessing feature.
               : Seems to work (M-x c-guess), but tab stops aren't updated.
               : Investigate per-buffer initialization which executes c-guess then sets the tab stops based on the c-guess.
                  : Invoking c-guess guess and installs the style.
                  : c-basic-offset is updated, likely to use this to set tab stops.
                  : Need to time initialization of many files
                     : If necessary, reduce default size of region to search for guessing style.
                  : Doesn't work: calling c-guess from the c-mode-common-hook
                  : Does work: M-x c-guess
      : How about using default behavior with keybindings for circumventing it.
   : Ordering of Evil init and customization.
      : Some of the customizations don't work when work when before, some after the evil init lines:
         (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/evil")
         (require 'evil)
         (evil-mode 1)
      : Doesn't work if after evil init:
         '(evil-overriding-maps nil)
      : Doesn't work if before evil init:
         '(evil-search-module (quote evil-search))
      : If there's a best practice for avoiding this gotcha, we should add it to the Wiki.  eg is there a call we can make to reinitialize evil?
   : Figure out what the debris files Emacs leaves behind are about, and whether to change settings to not create them.
      : Files with ~
      : Files with #
   : Opening through symlinks in an hg repo is slow by a factor of about 5.
   : Logging
      : Is there a way to get the current function's name, in order to put in log-msg prefix.
      : Is there a way to modify the message function (with defadvice or otherwise) to prepend timestamp?
   : Make s a prefix key
      : Define keymap for it.  eg:
         : this keymap would map f to 'delete-other-windows
         : s would be point to that keymap so as 'sf' invokes 'delete-other-windows
      : Figure out what disadvantage there is to mapping "sf" together, if any.
