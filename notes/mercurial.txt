Merge notes:
    : Personally, I need to see files changed first for both lines of development.  The simplest way I can find to do this is:
        : Determine most recent command predecessor revision (referred to here as predRev): hg merge -P | grep parent: | head -1
        : Determine heads you're merging with 'hg heads' (referred to here as dstRev and srcRev).
            : I find the return from 'hg parents' yields dstRev
            : I find the return from 'hg log --rev tip' yields srcRev.
            : 'hg heads -r predRev' can narrow the results, but isn't necessary.
            : Really just need to look at the heads that are on the same branch, as listed in 'hg heads'.
        : Get set of files changed:
            hg status --rev predRev:dstRev
            hg status --rev predRev:srcRev
        : To view the intersection of files changed:
            hg status -n --rev predRev:dstRev | sort > /tmp/dstFiles
            hg status -n --rev predRev:srcRev | sort > /tmp/srcFiles
            comm -12 /tmp/dstFiles /tmp/srcFiles
    : Ways to view file diff between rev A and B of FILE:
        : hg diff --rev A:B FILE
        : diffuse -r A -r B FILE
