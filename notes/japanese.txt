To install Japanese language input:
Follow https://help.ubuntu.com/community/JapaneseInput
  - Launch menu -> Languages -> Language Support -> Install / Remote Languages... -> Add... -> Japanese
  - Launch menu -> Language Settings -> Input method -> Japanese -> Follow onscreen instructions. Input method framework for Fcitx is there at the top.
Note: https://wiki.debian.org/JapaneseEnvironmentE doesn't work out on Linux Mint MATE.

On workstation:
  Followed go/linputjp except didn't find "Japanese (Mozc)".
  Proceeded to install just "Japanese", then tinkered with system tray settings.
