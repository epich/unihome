    Alternatve CrxMouse is blocked

  Google Docs
  smartUp Gestures
    can be janky.
      example: sometimes browser back once does so twice
  SimpleGestures
    seems ok
    can't customize gestures for tab left and right
  Rocker Gestures
    i can't get any rocker gestures to work.
      typical is that browser back infrequently works, whilst browser forward works more frequently.
Initial setup
  packages: autokey-gtk
  open Autokey
    create new script chrome-prev-tab
      keyboard.send_keys("<ctrl>+<shift>+<tab>")
    Hotkey: ctrl+`
    Window Filter: .*chrome
Notes:
  my .xbindkeysrc maps mouse forward browse button to ctrl+w to close tab
    it relies on xdotool package
