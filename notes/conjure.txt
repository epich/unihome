Hi, I'm interested in whether Conjure is suitable for building C projects.  Are there examples of these?

I thought I would take a look at Spells to see what it does there.  I ran into issues with your SPE scripts.  Specifically the scripts/fetch-systems failed to find the doro exec.  So I cloned it manually in systems directory and proceeded to follow the setup instructions.  After manually cloning several dependencies from Git, I arrived at this error:

epich-hp ~/git/spe/systems/dorodango : ./setup -i ypsilon --prefix `pwd`/install
* Using ypsilon
* Installing dorodango

error in define: attempt to modify immutable binding
  >  (define (cons* first . rest)
       (let recur ((x first) (rest rest))
         (if (pair? rest) (cons x (recur (car rest) (cdr rest))) x)))
  ..."/home/epich/git/spe/systems/dorodango/../_libs/srfi/%3a1/lists.sls"

               (cond ((null? maybe-elt) #f)
                     ((null? (cdr maybe-elt)) (car maybe-elt))
                     (else
                       (error
                         "Too many arguments to MAKE-LIST"
                         (cons len maybe-elt))))))
         (do ((i len (- i 1)) (ans '() (cons elt ans))) ((<= i 0) ans))))
       ...

  ..."/home/epich/git/spe/systems/dorodango/../_libs/srfi/%3a1/lists.sls" line 74

Anyway, I'm not inclined to proceed, since I was originally just wanting to see what Conjure did in Spells.
