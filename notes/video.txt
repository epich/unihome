    Preferred audio language: Japanese
    Output module:
      Automatic
        Has a stutter after unpause or rewind
        Tried:
          Show settings -> All -> Input/Codecs -> Advanced -> File caching -> Change from 1000 to say 100
            Settled on 120
          Effect: stutters, but durations are very short
          Seems about the most tolerable setting
      ALSA audio output
        Solves the stutter, but introduces high latency adjusting volume
      Change requires restarting VLC
    Normalize volume to
      Seemed to reintroduce stutter issues above
      Maybe introduced problem with volume adjustment delay

    Very short backwards jump
    Very short forward jump
  Bugs
